# CAT-NeRF
This repo includes the implementation for CAT-NeRF [CVPRW 2023]. We include our code for H36m dataset.

We follow the implementation of [Animatable NeRF](https://github.com/zju3dv/animatable_nerf). For data preparation and installation, please follow Animatable NeRF for data preparation and evironment setup. We also provide one of our pretrained model for `s11p` for validation of the installation. You can find the corresponding scripts in `train.sh` and `test.sh` as Animatable NeRF. There might be some small differences compared with our reported numbers in the paper due to the reorg of the project.
