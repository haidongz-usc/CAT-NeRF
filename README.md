# CAT-NeRF
This repo includes the implementation for CAT-NeRF [CVPRW 2023]. We include our code for H36m dataset.

We follow the implementation of [Animatable NeRF](https://github.com/zju3dv/animatable_nerf). For data preparation and installation, please follow Animatable NeRF for data preparation and evironment setup. We also provide one of our pretrained model for `s11p` for validation of the installation. You can find the corresponding scripts in `train.sh` and `test.sh` as Animatable NeRF. There might be some small differences compared with our reported numbers in the paper due to the reorg of the project.

If you have any questions, feel free to email me (haidongz@usc.edu)!
